Returning to Steven Soderbergh’s /Haywire/ right after Sam Mendes’ /Spectre/ turned
out to be a revealing experience.

Let’s check some data first.

|         | Budget        | Filming                  | Box office (US $) |
|---------+---------------+--------------------------+-------------------|
| Haywire | 23$ million   | 2 Feb 2010 - 25 Mar 2010 | 59.7$ million     |
| Spectre | ~250$ million | 8 Dec 2014 - 5 Jul 2015  | [[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bond24.htm][310.2$ million]]    |

I find these data particularly interesting, especially if we consider Haywire
all-star cast. Also, filming locations differ quite a bit in numbers and
variety.

|         | Filming locations                   |
|---------+-------------------------------------|
| Haywire | [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1506999/locations][USA, Spain, Ireland]]                 |
| Spectre | [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2379713/locations][Mexico, Austria, Morocco, Italy, UK]] |

I know, we don’t need strong evidence to see that Spectre is a /bigger/
film. However, what strikes me the most is how much Soderbergh accomplished with
less money and less time at his disposal.

Haywire is usually praised for the solid action scenes, superbly delivered by
Gina Carano’s own stunts. The lack of score during the fights highlights the
tension even more.

Haywire is so much more than that, though, and it takes a second viewing to
understand that Soderbergh did with Carano something akin to what he did with
Jennifer Lopez in the underrated /Out of Sight/. He worked on their bodies and
their acting, pulling out elegance (Lopez) and masculine sexuality (Carano) in
every camera movement.

Mendes treated Daniel Craig’s body and charm in an analogous way in /Skyfall/ and
/Spectre/. Sex is a menace, not an exotic pleasure anymore. Mendes knows that, but
he seems to focus more on his surrounding sets than his bodies. He did
understand the relevance of 007 body in /Skyfall/, but he deliberately chose not
to pursue that idea in /Spectre/. The last entry in the series goes back to what
Bond has always been: a one-dimensional character.

And that’s where all the brilliance of Haywire lies. The body of Gina Carano is
not just a seductive tool, nor it is a mannequin for a volatile display of
luxuries. It is the central, physical piece of a non-linear narration and it
holds everything together. Soderbergh plays with the beauty of his bodies. He
hugs them, breaks them, photographs them, sculpts them for our own very
amusement.
