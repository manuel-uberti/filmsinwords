I’ve been meaning to sum up this ending year for a while, but I had some
films left to watch and I just wanted to take them into consideration before
drawing conclusions.

I didn’t have the chance to go to film festivals (well, aside from [[http://www.festivalaltovicentino.it][the one I am
in charge of]]), but as usual cinema rules a significant part of my life.

2015 has been a year with great surprises. Off the top of my head and in no
particular order:

- George Miller came back to reinvigorate the action genre and claim his much
  deserved crown;
- Hou Hsiao-Hsien showed wuxia can still be fascinating and poetic;
- Ryan Coogler and Guillermo Del Toro crafted their masterpieces;
- Todd Haynes has never been so delicate and charming;
- Nanni Moretti has delivered one of his best films in recent years;
- Sam Mendes finally remembered how 007 really used to be;
- Steven Spielberg put himself on top of popular auterism again;
- Quentin Tarantino went political and found one of the highest peek of his
  career;
- Al Pacino proved he can still act the hell out of a character;
- Hong Kong is slowly finding the spirit that it seemed to have lost;
- Alejandro Iñarritu looked for Herzog and Coppola but didn’t make it.

2015 has also been the year where I could finally put my eyes on /Citizenfour/, a
documentary so necessary and vital I’m always baffled whenever I find someone
who hasn’t watched it and thought about it yet.

These are the films I liked the most, the ones able to keep my love for cinema
alive with their images and sounds. I’m listing them sorted by date of viewing.

- /Citizenfour/
- /Mad Max Fury Road/
- /Danny Collins/
- /Two Thumbs Up/
- /Love And Mercy/
- /The Assassin/
- /Spectre/
- /Mia Madre/
- /The Salvation/
- /Crimson Peak/
- /Carol/
- /Creed/
- /The Hateful Height/
- /Bridge of Spies/
