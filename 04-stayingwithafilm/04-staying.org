I would not call myself a cinephile if I didn’t like wandering through the
images of a film days, months, even years after I watched one. It is second
nature: staying with a film is just as important as watching it.

By /staying with a film/ I mean going back to it over and over again. It could be
another viewing or a piece of good criticism, it doesn’t matter. The important
thing is /being there/, keeping the images closer enough to enjoy the movie one
more time or to understand it better.

This a process that more often than not changes my perception of the film. Take
Paul Verhoeven’s *Showgirls*. I sat through it a couple of times before starting
to grasp its true beauty.

Showgirls has been widely panned since its release in 1995. It still is
considered a laughable waste of time. I never thought it was a bad movie, but it
took the splendid Adam Nayman’s book *It Doesn’t Suck: Showgirls* to make me love
Showgirls as much as I do now.

Nayman’s work pointed me in different directions. I connected the proverbial
dots, tracing Showgirls origins and looking for Verhoeven’s and scriptwriter Joe
Eszterhas’s intentions.

The use of the steadicam is particularly interesting. Again, upon watching
Showgirls again, I would not have paid attention to the realism and the play
with the American musical clichés had it not been for Nayman’s writings.

This is the power of well-done film criticism. Not only it enriches my
understanding of the film, but it enables me to stay with it as long as I want.
