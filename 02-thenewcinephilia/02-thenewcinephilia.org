It’s fair to say Girish Shambu’s [[https://www.caboosebooks.net/the-new-cinephilia]["The New Cinephilia"]] is what pushed me out of
my cavern. That and a mail from the author himself telling me “You should do
it!”.

I have been following Girish’s [[http://girishshambu.blogspot.it/][blog]] for so many years. I always liked the wide
range of his reflections. He expands on his thoughts with links to further
readings, therefore each of his posts often brings me out in the wild web to
read new pieces of criticism.

“The New Cinephilia” reads exactly as one of his blog posts. It reaches out for
new connections and new directions at every turn of the page. Not only it traces
the origins of contemporary film criticism, but in doing so it analyses what
makes modern cinephilia just as fascinating as the /old school/.

Social media have deeply expanded the possibilities we have nowadays to
understand films. Girish points out the relevance that even a single tweet has
and his acknowledgement is more than a hint to join the social network
revolution. Scholars, but also passionate amateurs such as myself could deeply
enhance their own experience if only they approached the Internet with
open-mindedness.

This is the most important lesson “The New Cinephilia” taught me. A lesson to
live by.
