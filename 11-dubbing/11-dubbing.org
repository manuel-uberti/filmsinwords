I grew up with dubbed films. Up until I was 23 years old, I had never watched a
film in its original language. Even when I started collecting DVDs and the
original audio track was presently available to me, I preferred relying upon the
Italian dubbing.

It took my better half and a great stretch of my mind to finally abandon myself
to the beauty of the language the film actually uses. I was afraid to let my
eyes distracted from the subtitles, because I was firmly convinced I would lose
some important details.

Nonsense. Soon I discovered Italy misses so many films every year, and the only
legal manner to watch them was buying DVDs from other countries. However, more
important than my struggle is the preciousness of other languages.

Accents, dialects, entire cultural heritage enabled me to appreciate films and
series on another level. Luckily enough, I missed /The Wire/ when it was
distributed in Italy, so when I eventually watched it I could lose myself in the
peculiar Baltimore English.

Dubbing transplants a film right into my country soil, reducing foreign
languages and cultures to a surrogate performance. Why should Toshiro Mifune
speak a perfect Italian? This is a basic question I will never forget myself for
not asking before.

Dubbing also impedes proper film criticism. It is hard to believe an Italian
film critic who judges an actress or an actor performance without hearing her or
his own true voice. There is a whole spectrum of emotions and signs that only
the voice can convey, and the best actresses and actors works on and with their
voices precisely to make their characters alive.

The perfect example of this is Robin Williams. Despite the best efforts of [[https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Valli][Carlo
Valli]], watching /Dead Poets Society/ dubbed in Italian is a miserable
experience. William’s deep and warm voice is just as unique as the way he
accompanies it with the calculated movements of his body.

Neither a powerful television nor superb speakers can replace the joy of
watching a film in a movie theatre. Unfortunately, Italy is so proud of its
dubbing, I can only dream of seeing more films screened in their original
language.
