#+TITLE: Keeping track

I like to keep track of the films I watch. I used MUBI in the past, but nowadays
I prefer a simpler solution.

I came up with an [[http://orgmode.org/][Org file]] with one table. Each row consists of:

- the row number;
- the film title, the director(s) and the year of release;
- the date when I watched the film;
- the grade.

Here is an extract from the file I have been using this year:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
| 207 | Man Up (Ben Palmer, 2015)                               | 04/10 | C+ |
| 208 | Inside Out (Docter, Del Carmen, 2015)                   | 05/10 | C  |
| 209 | Turbo Kid (Simard, Whissell, 2015)                      | 06/10 | E  | 
#+END_SRC

This file also helps me to track the films I have yet to watch.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
| 249 | Per Amor Vostro (Giuseppe Gaudino, 2015)                |       |    |
| 250 | High-Rise (Ben Wheatley, 2015)                          |       |    |
| 251 | Sicario (Denis Villeneuve, 2015)                        |       |    |
#+END_SRC

Since the file is in plain text, I can easily share it with
everyone. Furthermore, I can use the power of Org-mode and [[http://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]] to export it
in whichever format I need.
