When you look back at the considerations of film critics involved with vulgar
auteurism, it’s hard to find any mention at all about Lexi Alexander. Weird,
considering that the German-born director has done at least one film which fits
in pretty well with the category.

The shockingly underrated *Punisher: War Zone* might not be as fresh as John
Hyams’s takes on Universal Soldier. However, if we have to take for granted that
Justin Lin is a vulgar auteur, I’m here to demand the same amount of attention
for Lexi Alexander.

I mentioned John Hyams on purpose. Among the directors listed as vulgar auteurs,
Hyams is the only one who superbly reinvented a near-to-mediocre franchise.The
same goes for Alexander: her Punisher stands apart from the previous 2 movies.

While watching Punisher: War Zone, I felt Alexander shares some stylistic
resources with Hyams. A highly-personal light work; the solid and controlled
action sequences; the overall constant and palpable tension; the crude and
relentless violence. The psychotic environment surrounding the characters during
the final fight is thrilling and over-the-top just as Hyams’s last battle in
Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning.

Especially when dealing with violence, Alexander steps hard on the extreme
pedal. Although the director [[http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/lexi-alexander-says-she-wishes-marvel-had-made-creative-decisions-on-punisher-war-zone-instead-of-lionsgate-20150320][has stated]] that some creative decisions turned out
to be not the way she wanted, her film conveys graphic gore in a peculiar
way. Bodies are torn apart at almost every single shot of a gun, with buckets of
blood all over the scene. The non-stop brutality leaves no room for cheesy jokes
and slapstick fun. The /mise-en-scène/ of the shootouts here predates Pete
Travis’s Dredd. I’ll be surprised if Travis hadn’t seen this Punisher before
working on his Judge Dredd.

Who knows what might have happened with Punisher: War Zone if only had the
director had the chance to be in control like she desired. I can only wait for
her next move, hoping she will fulfil my dream to see her working with Elísabet
Ronalds.
