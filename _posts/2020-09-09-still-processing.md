As anyone approaching their twenties ravaged by hormones and victim of outbursts
of devastating infatuations, I did some crazy things. Acting foolish just to fit
in, neglecting family reunions to feel like a rebel, weekly looking for the
right clothes to show off my new personality with. The usual. I don’t regret
being that kid, but one thing I do regret is doing something the full extent of
which would hit me much later in my life.

    <em>Still Processing (Sophy Romvari, 2020)</em>
</p>

One day, absolute certain of my feelings, I grabbed a photograph of me around
the age of five and gave it to the girl that I thought I was going to spend the
rest of my life with. The picture was a matter of playful anecdotes in my house,
displaying me with a nice red hat, colourful shirt and fancy shorts playing the
drums left unattended at a town festival. My parents and my grandparents had
always remembered that day as clearly as I’ve never been able to.

Nobody noticed the absence of the photograph for a long while. Some years later,
my grandmother was arranging old pictures to display in her living room and
asked me for the drums one. I stood silent first, then I invented random words
about not being sure where my mum could have put it, and left the room to hide
somewhere. I cried, as I am practically doing right now while I relive this
episode in my head.

I am thrown back to that photograph and to what it meant to my grandmother by
Sophy Romvari’s latest short film *Still Processing[^1]*. The film starts with a box
of previously unseen family photos and videotapes which brings Romvari to
confront herself with memories that were waiting to be awakened. A fairly simple
premise, probably something that can happen to anybody, but Romvari does not
limit herself to filming how photographs inform the recollection of our family’s
past.

*Still Processing* is how the Canadian director reacts at being reminded of the
trauma of losing two of her brothers. Understanding the pictures in front of her
implies absorbing the loss through the process of film-making. In making sense
of the images and filming how she does it, Romvari makes her, her family, and
everyone else willing to be there with her short film, a part of a process that
is bound be perpetual. We can learn to live with a loss of a dear one and go on
with our lives, but can we really let it go? Someone or something could trigger
memories unexpectedly, and how we face those memories is up to us.

Romvari chooses to put her camera in front of the photos and the videotapes,
presenting them along with her reaction and that of her brother. The past is
alive again, the present never really free from it. It’s as if for her the
images alone were not enough to comprehend the memories. Only by processing them
she is finally able to connect with her family, see how it was and what is lost.
The fact that the images are as new to us as they are to her places us closer to
where she stands. We are not her family, but we are as near as possible to what
she feels while working on the objective necessity of the past.

At some point in *Still Processing* Romvari says that trauma is relative, which is
true if we consider the specificity of it. After all, I have never experienced
something along the line of what she has been through. However, *Still Processing*
shows that trauma stops being relative whenever we are able to share how it
affects us. Romvari opens the wounds for us to see with a grace that refuses
commiseration and asks for empathy.
