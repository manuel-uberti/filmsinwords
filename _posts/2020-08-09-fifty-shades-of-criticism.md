Often when I read about films I bookmark the great writings I find. I like to
re-read my favourite film criticism just to see how it is done by real critics.
Sometimes here on this blog I single out pieces I consider beautiful, but what
I am not in the habit of doing is pointing my finger at the bad ones.

    <em>Fifty Shades of Grey (Sam Taylor-Johnson, 2015)</em>
</p>

What this piece aims to do is subverting a writing which can barely call itself
a review. Let’s call it a short-review to hide its blatant rant side. It’s a
write-up on Sam Taylor-Johnson’s *Fifty Shades of Grey[^1]* which I am going to take
apart paragraph by paragraph because I want to offer a another opinion, mostly
an opposite one, on each and everyone of them. By the way, I wrote the words
I am about to destroy.

> First things first: I know nothing about the book, I know nothing about the
> director, and I didn't even notice this film when it came out. There, my

The problem with a start like this is that one feels they have to make sure the
reader will not be offended or at least should enter prepared. Why retreat from
the challenge with a poor display of humility? More importantly, why should the
reader care about my knowledge of the book? Does my ignorance have any relevance
to the words that follow? As we can see from the next paragraph I took a
completely different road, so there doesn’t seem to be any relation at all with
the rest of the comment.

As much as the meaning of the word *intimacy* is relevant to a film like *Fifty
Shades of Grey*, this paragraph touches little of what Taylor-Johnson actually
captures on the screen and it fails to read the images for what they offer.
Intimacy is a beautiful thing, it is what is missing in the lives of Anastasia
and Christian, and Taylor-Johnson works on this with her characters from various
angles.

Anastasia is pure, virginal frailty, searching for the intimacy she has yet to
experience. At every step of her relationship with Christian she moves further
into what intimacy means for her, deluded by the illusion of a romance that is
never going to happen. On the other hand, Christian twists his version of
intimacy aroused by the power of control. He imposes closeness while keeping it
at a distance, just as Anastasia wants to skip the distance and grab the
closeness once and for all.

There are two issues here, the first being really obvious. There is no
“stiffness” and the supposed “coldness” was blindness to the subtleties in the
acting. Jamie Dornan is the arrogant prick who lives in a world so far and away
from our everyday one it takes a forceful act to tear it down. His smug conveys
a self-assurance built on money and little else. The shifts in emotions which
Dornan translates with cracks on his face near the end are more effective than
the thousand words he could have used to explain his behaviour.

Dakota Johnson goes even further. She starts by displaying on her face and with
her body a seemingly total lack of confidence, but what lies beneath comes out
through her voice, her lips, and her eyes. And it’s there on the screen from the
very first meeting with Christian, where Anastasia battles against the awkward
feeling of being on another planet and the will to preserve the control of her
action. She doesn’t know where she is and yet she does know where she is. The
more she falls for Christian the more she lets down her guard, and Johnson lets
her body run along with it, being it drunk or trapped in a dance.

The second problem I was referring to is the power struggle in the sex scenes.
There is no power struggle here. We can see from the beginning where the power
is, so it’s not about power at all until the final moments. Sex in *Fifty Shades
of Grey* is about controlling passion and passionate control. It’s about pushing
the limits knowingly until the veil is stripped and the limits are exposed for
what they are. The statement about class is to be found in everything but sex.

I am glad I moved beyond this simplistic view of artificiality. Taylor-Johnson
is so much more than “smooth lights”, like in the incredible meeting scene,
where the playfulness of love intersects with anxiety and lust, fear and
curiosity, all cast under a dark orange light which shows and conceals at the
same time. This scene alone is enough to trash any accusation of “music video
style”.

Moreover, believability is not about how I can relate to the furniture.
Taylor-Johnson builds spaces which reflect the emptiness of Christian. He uses
objects as he uses women, and he discards them oblivious to their meaning and
the reason of their presence. Cleanliness is coldness and that is what Christian
is, framed in rooms so impersonal and detached from the reality of his mind. He
is a stranger in warmer places as at his parents’ house, just like Anastasia
never really fits in large spaces with no sense of humanity in them.

Ōshima Nagisa and Bernardo Bertolucci did exploit prudery, but to reduce
Taylor-Johnson’s work to a “trite erotic fantasy” is misreading it to say the
least. It’s missing the meaning of fantasy entirely. *Fifty Shades of Grey* takes
the fantasy of erotic pleasure and purges it of any satisfaction up to the point
it becomes unbearable. Not because of what Taylor-Johnson chooses to show and
not to show when portraying sex, but because what matters is the grey, not the
shades.
