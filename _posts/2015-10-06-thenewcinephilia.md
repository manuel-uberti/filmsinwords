It’s fair to say Girish Shambu’s [*The New
Cinephilia*](https://www.caboosebooks.net/the-new-cinephilia) is what pushed me
out of my cavern. That and a mail from the author himself telling me “You should
do it!”.

I have been following Girish’s [blog](http://girishshambu.blogspot.it/) for so
many years. I always liked the wide range of his reflections. He expands on his
thoughts with links to further readings, therefore each of his posts often
brings me out in the wild web to read new pieces of criticism.

*The New Cinephilia* reads exactly as one of his blog posts. It reaches out for
new connections and new directions at every turn of the page. Not only it traces
the origins of contemporary film criticism, but in doing so it analyses what
makes modern cinephilia just as fascinating as the old school.

Social media have deeply expanded the possibilities we have nowadays to
understand films. Girish points out the relevance that even a single tweet has
and his acknowledgement is more than a hint to join the social network
revolution. Scholars, but also passionate amateurs such as myself could deeply
enhance their own experience if only they approached the Internet with
open-mindedness.

This is the most important lesson *The New Cinephilia* taught me. A lesson to
live by.
