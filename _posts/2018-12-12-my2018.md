In terms of cinematic experiences 2018 has been an amazing year. Although I have
a couple of titles among this year’s finest already added to my all-time
favourites, 2018 will be remembered as the time when my cinephilia expanded in
incredible and inspiring ways like never before. The key game-changer has been
[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/muberti/).

When it comes to social networks, I am sceptical to say the least. For a while
I have enjoyed Facebook, Twitter, and Mastodon as much as anybody else, but
early in 2017 I decided to put an end to my social-networked life. Privacy
concerns, yes, but also the obnoxious feeling of time wasted.

Letterboxd is a community of cinephiles sharing their love, and as such I rarely
encounter endless off-topics and pointless discussions. More importantly, it
conceals in plain view treasures of film criticism. The writings and the
opinions of [Mallory Andrews](https://letterboxd.com/mallory_andrews/), [Neil Bahadur](https://letterboxd.com/neilbahadur/), [Jake Cole](https://letterboxd.com/jakepcole/), [Filipe Furtado](https://letterboxd.com/filipe_furtado/), [Willow
Maclay](https://letterboxd.com/catelyn/) and [Michael Sicinski](https://letterboxd.com/msicism/)—to name a few!—have served as my guiding light in
the realms of cinema. By and large thanks to their contributions on Letterboxd,
I discovered a proper appreciation of Brian De Palma and George Lucas, fell
madly in love with Abel Ferrara and Charles Chaplin, embraced Jean-Luc
Godard and Samuel Fuller, reconsidered Martin Scorsese’s and Michael Mann’s turn
of the century efforts, and now have a better understanding of Chantal Akerman
and Claire Denis. Not to mention the hundreds of films already in my watchlist,
plus the sheer willingness to write about cinema as an enjoyable outcome.

Moreover, Letterboxd helps me make sense of the unstoppable flux of images on my
screen. I have kept track of the best of 2018 in [a dedicated list](https://letterboxd.com/muberti/list/2018/), an undeniable
improvement to my plain text files technique. And if you are into statistics and
data, [something worth every penny](https://letterboxd.com/muberti/year/2018/) is provided to. Addictive to say the least.

As I mentioned above, there are two films that stood out from the rest of the
2018 pack: *An Elephant Sitting Still* and *Ready Player One*. I [wrote at length](https://www.filmsinwords.eu/cinephilia/2018/10/31/elephant.html) on
the former, and [only hinted](https://www.filmsinwords.eu/cinephilia/2018/11/15/lucas.html) at the latter aggressive combination of nostalgia
and juvenile fun. What’s more, they have something in common. Hu
Bo’s masterpiece is a desperate look at a world in which traces of optimism are
scarce and therefore more precious than ever, while Steven Spielberg’s adventure
is full of fervent belief in a greater good despite the growing distance between
the rich and the poor. Both films acknowledge the need, now more than ever, for
a change. They use different means to the same end: hope.

Since the latest Jia Zhangke’s and Wang Bing’s are still outside of my radar,
I consider the rest of 2018 output moderately interesting. *Padmavaat* is a
heartbreaking tragedy from the director of the superb *Bajirao Mastani*, while
*First Reformed* is easily the most puzzling Paul Schrader. Tsui Hark and Steven
Soderbergh, albeit not at the top of their abilities, proved again able to
surprise me in unexpected ways. Much the same can be said of Spike Lee, even
though he did not bite like he used to, but I am confused about Clint
Eastwood’s *The 15:17 to Paris*. Not sure what to do with it. On the other hand,
Paul Feig finally met my taste with his playfully sexy *A Simple Favor*.

Contrary to popular criticism, I enjoyed *Terminal* just as thoroughly as I wanted
to enjoy *Red Sparrow* and *Upgrade*. Scott Adkins played the role of his acting
career in *Accident Man*, but I stand firm in my conviction that Amy Johnston is
the martial artist we deserve. *Braven* in all its predictability is simply the
action film *The Predator* fails to be. Shockingly, it was even more entertaining
than *The Night Comes for Us*. I’ve already forgotten about *Ocean’s Eight*, and
I did not connect neither with *Sorry to Bother You* nor with *American Animals*.
I preferred the bleakness of *River’s Edge* to the one of *Burning*, but they will
both be remembered for the darkness within.

A couple of horror films this year spoke about technology better than almost
anything cinema has ever tried in this regard: *Cam* and *Unfriended: Dark Web*.
They are a bit rough around the edges, but they convey the terrifying
preoccupations contemporary society keeps missing. No [Daniel Goldhaber](http://www.thecinephiliacs.net/2018/11/episode-110-daniel-goldhaber-showgirls.html), I am
sorry: there is nothing of *Showgirls* in *Cam*.

Then, the outsiders: Jean-Marie Straub’s *Gens du Lac* is a reminder of how much
meaning a camera pan can ultimately have, while Jean-Luc Godard dropped *Westerly
Wind* as the true warrior he is. They both conquered me in ways Apichatpong
Weerasethakul’s *Blue* did not, but he moved me anyhow like he always does.

I cannot leave 2018 without a couple of words on Bernardo Bertolucci. He taught
me cinephilia and love for cinema with *The Dreamers*, and much of my passion
comes from the pivotal experience of him entering my life before I was twenty
years old. Not even with his best work, and yet here I am. Thank you, Bernardo.
