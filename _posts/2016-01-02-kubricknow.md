Lately I’ve found myself deeply immersed in [Michel Chion's
work](http://michelchion.com/books/68-stanley-kubrick) on Stanley Kubrick. I
took it as a reason to go back to Kubrick’s oeuvre, connecting the dots and
trying to figure out what the great director means today.

    <em>Eyes Wide Shut (Stanley Kubrick, 1999)</em>
</p>

In particular, I’m thinking about what his works mean for me now. I remember
being shocked by *A Clockwork Orange* at 14. I remember buying *2001: A Space
Odyssey* on VHS and watching it three times in two days struggling to understand
the “what?” and the “why?”. I remember sitting alone with just two other guys in
an empty movie theatre waiting for *Paths of Glory* to begin. I also remember
comparing *Full Metal Jacket* to *Saving Private Ryan* in a conversation with my
grandfather — and I’ll never forget his colourful defence of Spielberg’s effort.

Nonetheless, it’s been a while since my last revisiting of a film by Kubrick. Of
course Chion’s book is not just a reminder, but an in-depth analysis of all
Kubrick’s works. The French critic doesn’t hide his preferences. On the
contrary, he is plain enough to say which films he likes less in the first
pages.

I tried not to let Chion’s opinions interfere with my own conclusions. Two films
had an unexpected effect on me: *2001: A Space Odyssey* and *Eyes Wide Shut*.

Young and with few clues in film criticism, I was the kind of film geek ready to
come to my fists to defend *2001: A Space Odyssey*. I praised the camera work,
the editing and the use of music as if nobody better than me knew what I was
talking about. Today *2001: A Space Odyssey* has a different effect on me. The
long stretch of visual tricks in the last part left my eyes tired and eager to
move on. It felt more like a series of images to contemplate from a distance. As
philosophers do, Chion says, but I’m not used to doing that with films.

On the other hand, *Eyes Wide Shut* turned out to be the one I love the most. I
read Schnitzler’s *Traumnovelle* right after watching it and I watched *Eyes
Wide Shut* again once I finished the novella. It’s such an inspired and
inspiring film. Its elegant usage of words and sounds is only matched by the
careful lightning and editing. There is so much going on in every silence, in
every gaze. Kubrick never questions his characters actions, and characters do
the same. As Chion notices, the only character who steps up and judges someone
else — Milich — will end up showing no morality whatsoever.

*Eyes Wide Shut* plays like a modern tale of human beings that haven’t changed
that much since Schnitzler captured them 90 years ago. However, it’s not a
cautionary tale, but a quiet acceptance of the ordinary in all its
impossibilities. Stanley Kubrick has never been so humane, and probably this is
why *Eyes Wide Shut* will always stand for how I want to remember the great
director.
