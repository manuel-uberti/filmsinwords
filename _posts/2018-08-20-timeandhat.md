After watching Michael Mann’s *Blackhat* again last night, I looked around the
internet to check what other people think about it. I remembered some were
utterly disappointed by it, even frustrated, but others seemed to share my
passion.

As it often happens in film criticism, critics draw comparison with other works
when writing on a specific film. For instance, Keith Uhlich on [Reverse
Shot](http://reverseshot.org/reviews/entry/1989/blackhat) notices similarities
between *Blackhat* and *Eyes Wide Shut* in terms of unsettling dialogues.

> Performance-wise this is one of Mann’s strangest movies, cultivating a
> dead-air hesitancy in almost every dialogue exchange, the likes of which I
> haven’t experienced since Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut (1999).

David Ehrlich on
[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/davidehrlich/film/blackhat/) points at
Johnnie To:

> BLACKHAT is Michael Mann’s Johnnie To movie.

However, nobody, at least to my knowledge, links *Blackhat* to Tsui Hark’s *Time
And Tide*. This is not to say that Mann had Tsui in mind when devising his
superb cyber-thriller, but there are interesting aspects of *Time And Tide* that
Mann seems to explore with his style.

Both films abstract the narrative away, using it only to provide a model upon
which building a complex interplay of camera movements, editing and sounds.
Characters have little to no background, dropped in occasionally for
context’s sake. Relationships are a thin layer, and romance though a driving
force is instrumental to the courses of action and not the ultimate ending.

Mann and Tsui use the camera to deconstruct the action instead of creating it.
Our eyes are placed under the keys of a keyboard in *Blackhat* and inside a
washing machine in *Time And Tide*. And yet we always know where we are, we
never lose the sense of what is happening inside and outside the frame. We
follow the camera and not the characters, we are moved by the editing and not by
the plot.

Sounds are the last piece of the puzzle here. Clicks, footsteps, ambient noises,
collateral damages. We are surrounded not by the blast of the guns, but by a
vibrant environment. A living, breathing space with its voices and its echoes.
The scene embraces us, the images are constantly interrogating us.

*Blackhat* and *Time And Tide* rank among the most experimental works of Michael
Mann and Tsui Hark respectively. If it’s true that Tsui was already trying new
paths in his 1995 masterpiece *The Blade*, it’s also true that he has gone down
different roads eventually. Mann, on the other hand, has been perfecting his
abstractions over and over again, finally reaching the point where he is able to
leave us only with an interface to his model of cinema.
