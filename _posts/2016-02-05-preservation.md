A while ago, I had an interesting conversation on Twitter with film scholar and
critic Rowena Santos Aquino. It all started from her [pointing
out](https://twitter.com/FilmStillLives/status/687354831594373121) a [beautiful
article](http://www.filmcomment.com/blog/kaiju-shakedown-disappearing-in-plain-sight/)
by Grady Hendrix on, among other things, the lack of film preservation efforts
in Hong Kong. Some days later, Rowena linked [this
article](http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/film-tv/article/1906440/film-review-alls-well-ends-well-lunar-new-year-screwball-classic)
to me, in which Paul Fonoroff talks about a newly restored version of Clifton Ko
Chi-Sum’s *All’s Well, Ends Well*.

    <em>Bullets Over Summer (Wilson Yip, 1999)</em>
</p>

The conversation immediately fired up my never-ending love for Hong Kong cinema.
So I went through my DVD collection and pulled out my copy of *Bullets Over
Summer*. I couldn’t help but thinking of Grady Hendrix’s words while the closing
credits where crawling bottom-to-top.

*Bullets Over Summer* probably doesn’t have the power of Fruit Chan’s best works
when it comes to dealing with post-handover tensions. Nonetheless, Wilson Yip
relates to the loss of Hong Kong’s identity in his own peculiar way.

The director explores time and its passing, focusing on relationships between
people of different age and generations. It is really illuminating to notice how
these relationships change day after day. They are never destined to last
forever, but what they offer is precious moments of joy and playfulness. They
can be relentlessly caring, tender and romantic, and they can also turn out to
be something entirely unexpected.

However beautiful these interactions are, time moves on and slowly the
characters lose everything: a friend, a lover, money, a purpose, a family. The
old Granny exemplifies the inevitability of time and its consequences at best.
Memory doesn’t serve her well anymore, presumably due to some sort of
Alzheimer’s disease. She seems to find a peace of mind in her motherly role,
desperately believing that her surrogate reality is the only thing left to live
by. Just as much as Mike believes until the very end he can provide for his
new-found loved ones.

*Bullets Over Summer* acts like a lesson on the fragility of our dreams and has
left me with a warning. There is a little bit of Granny’s reality in every Hong
Kong cinema lover out there, including me. I remember back in 2014 at Far East
Film Festival a whole weekend dedicated to Hong Kong, with talks and writings
devoted to an industry that had necessarily transformed itself. Somehow, the
naive nostalgia felt bigger than the actual certainty that Hong Kong will never
be the same again.
