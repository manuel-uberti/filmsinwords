Instead of a list of the best films I saw this year, I would like to take a
different approach. I keep track of every film I watch, so it is easy to
highlight what really matters. Be it a classic from the 40s or a lost gem of the
90s, cinema is always much more than a mere round up.

The first two films I watched in 2016 have lasted in my heart throughout the
whole year: Buñuel’s *Belle de Jour* and Fellini’s *8½*. Enough has already been
written about these masterpieces, and I do not feel up to the task of exploring
them critically. If I had to pick a word to describe the powerful feelings both
of them left me with I would use “contemporary”.

I filled January and early February with other classics: *Aguirre the Wrath of
God*, *The Apartment*, *All About Eve*, *Bonnie and Clyde*, *Bride of
Frankenstein*, *City Lights*, *Modern Times*, *Beauty and the Beast*, *On the
Waterfront*. For one reason or another, I had always put these masterpieces
aside until the beginning of 2016. Shame on me.

Alongside these viewings, I caught the good *Straight Outta Compton*, the great
*White God* and the interesting *Anomalisa*. 2016 has been a year of many
deaths, so I mourned the loss of Alan Rickman with tears over *Truly Madly
Deeply* and sad laughs with one of my all-time favourite *Galaxy Quest*.

During the first months of 2016, I discovered the works of Gina
Prince-Bythewood, with *Beyond the Lights* heading the lot, before Hong Kong
cinema nostalgia kicked back hard. Thus Peter Chan, Ching Siu-Tung, Wilson Yip,
Johnny Wang, Patrick Leung, Wong Jing, Jeff Lau, Ringo Lam, Soi Cheang, Ann Hui,
Kirk Wong and Tsui Hark sneaked right before I watched both the fantastic
Johnnie To’s *Office* and Stephen Chow’s *The Mermaid*. Johnnie To came back
later in the year with another hit: *Three*.

I did not manage to see them when they were out in 2015, but *Listen to Me
Marlon* and *Shaun the Sheep Movie* deserve a mention. The former is one of the
most fascinating documentaries I have seen, while the latter can easily make
anyone laugh without uttering a word.

Following *Citizenfour*, I tracked down the other works of Laura Poitras. The
director is investigating on our political and economical world with an eye of
her own.

While *Miles Ahead*, *Midnight Special* and *Snowden* did not strike me as
something I will remember, Bhansali’s *Bajirao Mastani* is everything *The
Jungle Book* is not, and Guzman’s *The Pearl Button* is what I hoped *Fire at
Sea* could be.

I will soon return to Park Chan-wook’s *The Handmaiden*, because it puzzled me
more than any other film this year. South Korea and Japan delivered a couple of
entries for the zombie horror genre that surprised me in lots of good ways:
*Train to Busan* and *I Am a Hero*. Japan also left a mark on the monster genre
with the outstanding *Shin Gojira*. Only Verhoeven’s *Elle* matched the same
high expectations that drove me up to the screen before the viewing.

2016 saw Jia Zhangke once again stealing my heart with his mesmerizing
*Mountains May Depart*. Why it is not near the top of all the best-of lists out
there is beyond my comprehension.

*Miss Okusai* showed Japan animation is still one or two steps ahead the rest of
the world, but it would not be fair to leave the beautiful *Kubo and the Two
Strings* out of this recap.

A year in films is not properly summed up unless I mention my guilty pleasures.
*Wild Card* is Statham like he has never been, and *The Shallows* overtook my
doubts about another shark-attack film within ten minutes I was in.

I have not seen many critic’s favourite yet, but I cannot complain. 2016 proved
to be a great year to be a cinema lover.
