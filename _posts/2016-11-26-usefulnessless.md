Unexpectedly, it took me more than usual to process Oliver Stone’s *Snowden*. It
is not a convoluted film nor its craft stroke me as the more rewarding *JFK*. It
is its inexplicable *usefulnessless* that kept tormenting my brain days after
the viewing.

    <em>Snowden (Oliver Stone, 2016)</em>
</p>

On various occasions, Edward Snowden referred to himself as being just a piece
of the bigger picture, the least significant detail of an ongoing narrative. It
is, and always has been, the bigger picture what we have to care about.

In this respect, Stone did surprisingly well. *Snowden* dodges the misleading
trailer and carefully balances the man and the story. It delivers an on point
drama not that much concerned with Edward Snowden’s private life. And for once,
cinema treats computer culture with decency.

However, the same question I asked myself at the end of the film still resonates
with me. Put it bluntly: what is the point of *Snowden*?

The vital importance of Edward Snowden’s actions should never be underestimated,
nonetheless Laura Poitras’s outstanding *Citizenfour* is out there for everyone
to watch and learn from. Edward Snowden himself is streaming talks and
interviews from Russia regularly and looks alive and well on Twitter. Following
the consequences of his disclosures is just a click away. This easily rules out
my first thought: Stone is not aiming to spread the message, unless he thinks
awfully low of his viewers.

*Snowden* fictionalizes many scenes from *Citizenfour*, staying as close as
possible to the source material. Together these scenes turn out to be a
fictional documentary that relies heavily upon an actual documentary, resulting
in a trite exercise of style. It might serves the narration well, but it runs
the risk of hiding the real work from the ones who have not seen it yet.

Then again, if *Citizenfour* already tells it the way it has to be told, what
was Stone hoping to achieve? Of all the things we could have done after watching
*Snowden*, speculating about its objective is the most trivial one.
