I am never aware of the amount of hours I dedicate to a director I am in love
with, although the actual number would probably scare me, leading me to think
about the time spent in front of a screen. Like in any love relationship, the
first days are frenetic. Everything seems to be happening right outside of
one’s reach, the mind wrapped into dreams and thoughts that are now slowly
withdrawing to leave enough room for new dreams and thoughts. Time makes no
sense and it takes days, weeks even for the fog the mind is happily struggling
through to clear away.

    <em>Paul W.S. Anderson (<a href="https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2013/06/19/paul_ws_anderson_on_filming_pompeii_in_toronto.html">The
    Star</a>)</em>
</p>

Recently I’ve enjoyed a similar situation when I discovered what I had been
missing in Paul W.S. Anderson for many years. I was already familiar with some
of his work and I knew most of my favourite critics agree on the qualities of
his film-making skills, but I couldn’t see these qualities. I couldn’t see that
the man behind the films has always been a passionate and dedicated author since
his beginnings, firm in his belief of what matters in the cinema he wants to do[^1].
Once again, I was reading films instead of watching them.

Reading a film, in my case, means focusing on certain aspects. Due to the lack
of a proper education in film studies, books help me explore cinema and film
criticism: biographies give me background context, while monographs provide me
with some necessary tools to dig deeper. These books usually come recommended by
reliable sources (i.e., the afore-mentioned film critics name-dropping a title),
otherwise I just move by instinct and read about a director or a genre at any
given moment. Such an approach has been proving useful since I started showing
an interest in cinema beyond entertainment, but it’s a narrow vision. By
limiting my analysis to the connection between the images on the screen and the
words on paper I was missing a crucial facet: the experience of watching.

Anderson’s career makes for a great candidate to understand the experience of
watching because within the confines of specific genres (science fiction,
horror, and action), the English director has been consistently pushing for an
aesthetic of the senses. Anderson is primarily a visual artist, all of his films
living in their own world in terms of how they are perceived by the
viewer’s eyes. This is true in general in Anderson’s filmography, but it is
noticeable on a smaller scale too, such as in the *Resident Evil* series where
each chapter has its decisively distinct look.

The architecture of indoor and outdoor spaces is key to the eloquence of
Anderson’s style. Fascinated by mazes, he traps the characters in perpetual
displacement. Extra-dimensional forests, roads to nowhere, shape-shifting rooms,
claustrophobic tunnels, and impending natural disasters constraint people and
force the action to develop itself in places where escape, if any, comes at a
high cost. Never in Anderson the background functions perfunctorily as a
container for the action in the foreground. Whether controlled by an artificial
intelligence or a corporation, propelled by nature’s uncompromising power or
just waiting to be set in motion by human intervention, stages are as much of a
tangible presence as anything and anyone inhabiting them.

</p>

The move to digital from *Resident Evil: Afterlife* onwards has not only increased
the opportunities for Anderson to expand his architectural designs[^2]. Digital has
opened Anderson’s style to a contrast with analogue forms. This contrast is
already present in *Alien vs. Predator*, where computer-generated imagery extends
the possibilities of suits and miniatures. However, the complete upshot of
digital power would come to life later, when everything can be extended with the
new technology. Artificiality does not simply become the new organic. Anderson
preserves the organic through its changes via the artificial, in a dialectical
interplay reminiscent of Hegel’s sublation. In *Resident Evil: Retribution*, Alice
is a human-created clone that discovers the instinct of motherhood by caring for
a manufactured daughter. Worlds do not collide: it is necessary to comprehend
them in their unity with their mutual relationship.

In placing life and death at the centre of the interaction between natural and
artificial, Anderson has been revealing a humanitarian philosophy underpinning
the entire span of his career. In this regard, *Pompeii* is his most poetic
accomplishment. A profoundly personal project, *Pompeii* is a narration of lives
divided by social conflicts and clashes of powers eventually obliterated by
death, the greatest equalizer. Since the tragedy of the city of Pompeii is
well-known, the eruption of Mount Vesuvius is cathartic only insofar as it
liberates everybody from their personal struggles. Anderson again stretches and
maintains the contradiction until its unity is revealed, only this time the two
opposites are absolute dissolution and relative preservation instead of analogue
vis-a-vis digital. The ending of *Pompeii* is precisely this difference removed.
Life as a romance is no more, death as the unassailable destroyer is no more.
Romance and thus life carry on after death, as temporary as they are
never-ending.

    included in the Blu-rays.

    hardware to enjoy it, hence I am not going to comment on it.
