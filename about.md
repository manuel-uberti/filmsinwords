Hi, I’m Manuel!

This blog is a place where I can collect all my thoughts on cinema and
cinephilia. I’ve always enjoyed writing, and writing about films in particular.
I tend to write about films I like instead of destroying the ones I don’t, but
the occasional rant can sneak in. No promises.

You can also find me on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/muberti/).
