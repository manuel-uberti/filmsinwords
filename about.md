Hi, I’m Manuel Uberti and I’m a passionate cinephile.

This blog is a place where I can collect all my thoughts on cinema and
cinephilia. I’ve always enjoyed writing, and writing about films in particular.

In the past I contributed to [AsianFeast.org](http://www.asianfeast.org/) and
[China Files](https://www.china-files.com/).

You can also find me on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/muberti/).
