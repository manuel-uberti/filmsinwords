## Me

Hi, I’m Manuel! Thank you for stopping by.

This blog is a place where I can collect all my thoughts on cinema and
cinephilia. I tend to add comments the films I watch on my BuJo, but this blog
helps me elaborate on specific topics and opinions. It’s also a fun exercise
because English is not my first language.

If you wish to receive updates you can subscribe to this blog via [RSS](https://www.filmsinwords.eu/feed.xml).

By the way, I have [a personal website](https://www.manueluberti.eu/) for the more technology-driven side of my
life. Check it out if the word “*Emacs*” makes any sense to you.

## Website

This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a slightly modified version of [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). The
source code of the entire website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/manuel-uberti/filmsinwords).
