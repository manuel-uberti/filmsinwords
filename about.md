## Me

Hi, I’m Manuel! Thanks for stopping by!

This blog is a place where I can collect all my thoughts on cinema and
cinephilia. I’ve always enjoyed writing, and writing about films in particular.
I tend to add comment on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/muberti/) for all
the films I watch, but this blog helps me elaborate on specific topics and
opinions. It’s also a fun exercise for me, since I love writing in English but
English is not my first language.

You can subscribe to this blog via [RSS](https://www.filmsinwords.eu/feed.xml),
if you wish to receive updates.

Also, if you are interested in computer programming, I have [another
blog](https://manuel-uberti.github.io/) for the more technical-driven side of my
life.

## Website

This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a slightly
modified version of [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). The source code
of the entire website is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/manuel-uberti/filmsinwords).
